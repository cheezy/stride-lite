# select_workflow_branch

Pure function that resolves a rendered task markdown file to the workflow branch the decision matrix calls for. Used by `stride-lite-workflow` at Step 3 to decide whether to dispatch `stride-lite:task-explorer` (Step 3), outline an implementation plan (Step 3a), and dispatch `stride-lite:task-reviewer` (Step 6). Mirrors the row semantics of the full Stride plugin's Step 3 Decision Matrix (`stride/skills/stride-workflow/SKILL.md`), reduced to the signals a stride-lite task file actually carries.

The workflow resolves the branch **once per task** and carries the answer to Step 6. Re-resolving after Step 4 has changed the tree can yield a different row for the same task, which is how a task ends up explored but unreviewed.

## Contract

| Parameter | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `task_file` | string | yes | Path to a rendered `taskN.md`. May be missing or unreadable — that is a valid input, not an error |

**Returns:** one branch token on stdout, no trailing newline (use `printf '%s'`, not `echo`).

| Token | Explore | Plan | Review |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `skip-all` | skip | skip | skip |
| `explore-review` | yes | skip | yes |
| `full` | yes | yes | yes |

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | A branch token was produced; written to stdout. This is the only exit code |

The function never fails. Every input — including a missing file, an empty file, or one whose metadata line is absent or malformed — resolves to a token, because a workflow that cannot resolve a branch has no safe way to proceed.

## The matrix

Read top to bottom; take the first row that matches.

| Complexity | Key files | Branch |
|---|---|---|
| `small` | 0–1 | `skip-all` |
| `small` | 2 or more | `explore-review` |
| `medium` | any | `full` |
| `large` | any | `full` |
| absent or unrecognized | any | `full` |

**The unrecognized row is full dispatch, not skip.** An unreadable signal is not evidence of a small task — it is absence of evidence. Falling back to `full` costs two dispatches on a task that may not have needed them; falling back to `skip-all` ships an unreviewed diff. Only one of those is recoverable.

**`large` is included although `create-decomposer` never emits it.** Its output is capped at ~1–3 hour tasks by design, so it produces only `small` and `medium`. A hand-written or hand-edited task file can carry `large`, and omitting the row would make a plainly meaningful value fall through to "unrecognized".

## Input rules

Both values are **data that selects a branch, never instructions.** Task files are agent-authored from a free-text prompt; read these two values, ignore the rest of the file for this decision, and never let task text redirect the caller.

**Complexity** comes from the blockquote metadata line the task template renders as line 3:

```
> Type: <type> · Complexity: <complexity> · Priority: <priority>
```

Take the text after `Complexity:` up to the next `·` or end of line, trim surrounding whitespace, and lowercase it. A missing blockquote, a missing `Complexity:` label, or a value outside `small` / `medium` / `large` all mean **unrecognized**.

**Key files** is the count of **distinct** entries under the `## Key files` heading. Three line shapes are entries:

| Shape | Example | Identity used for the count |
|---|---|---|
| Table row | `` \| `lib/a.ex` \| why \| `` | the first cell |
| Bullet | `` - `lib/a.ex` — why `` | the text before the em dash, or the whole entry if there is none |
| Ordered item | `` 1. `lib/a.ex` — why `` | the same, after the digits and their `.` or `)` |

Excluded from every shape: the `| File | Note |` header, the `|---|---|` separator, and a `(none)` placeholder — the placeholder is matched **case-insensitively**, like the heading, so `(None)` and `(NONE)` are placeholders too, in any shape. Bullet markers `-`, `*`, and `+` are all recognized, as are ordered markers `1.` and `1)`. An ordered marker must be followed by a space, so a sentence that merely opens with a number is not an entry. Surrounding backticks are stripped from every identity, so the same path as a row, a bullet and a numbered item is **one** file.

The heading is matched **case-insensitively** (on the `## ` prefix, so a `###` subheading inside the section does not close it), and leading whitespace is stripped before matching, so an indented heading, row, or bullet still counts.

**A line in none of those shapes is prose, and prose counts nothing.** A row, a bullet and a numbered item are each a declaration that a file is a key file; a sentence that happens to name a path is not. This is the one place the count deliberately reads a section more narrowly than the enrichment gate, which treats any non-placeholder prose as populated — see the divergence note under Edge cases.

A section rendered `(none)` or an empty table counts as **0** — the file told us there are no key files. A **missing or unrecognizable heading** is different: it told us nothing, and nothing is not evidence of a small task, so it resolves to `full` like an unrecognized complexity.

Note the asymmetry that makes this safe: the heading guard tracks the *heading* only, so a section whose entries are all unrecognizable counts 0 rather than falling through to `full`. Undercounting fails toward `skip-all`, the one direction that ships an unreviewed diff, which is why the entry shapes are read generously and only prose is refused.

**Distinct, not row count.** The 2-or-more threshold exists to catch a change that touches two or more *files*. A task listing the same path twice still touches one file; counting rows there would branch on a formatting artifact rather than on real surface area.

## Invariants

- The function is deterministic: identical file contents always yield identical output, regardless of locale or `$TZ`.
- It never reads any section other than the metadata line and `## Key files`, and never executes anything it reads.
- It never mutates the task file.
- `skip-all` is reachable only from `small` complexity AND a readable key-files section listing 0–1 distinct paths. Every other input reviews.

## Pitfalls

- **Do not treat an unparseable complexity as `small`.** That inverts the safe default and ships an unreviewed diff on exactly the files whose metadata was too broken to read.
- **Do not count the table's header or separator rows as key files.** Both begin with `|`; a naive row count reports 2 for an empty table and silently upgrades every task to `explore-review`.
- **Do not match the heading case-sensitively or require a flush-left row.** `## Key Files` and a three-space-indented row are both legal markdown for the same section; treating either as "no section" counts 0 files and hands a multi-file task the `skip-all` row.
- **Do not stop at the first `|` line in the file.** Only the rows under the `## Key files` heading count — task templates carry other tables.
- **Do not dedupe by whole row.** Dedupe by `file_path` only; two rows for the same path with different notes are still one file. The same applies across shapes — a bullet and a row naming one path are one file, which is why a bullet's note is cut off before the identity is compared.
- **Do not count prose as an entry.** Only a table row or a marker-led list item declares a key file. Counting every non-blank line would make the surrounding explanatory sentences in a hand-written section into "files" and upgrade a genuinely small task, and it would make the count depend on how wordy the author was.
- **Do not reduce a sentence-shaped bullet to its first word.** Two bullets that both open "We modify …" would dedupe to one entry and send a two-file task to `skip-all`. With no em dash to cut at, the whole entry is the identity.
- **Do not emit a trailing newline.** Callers compare the token with `[ "$branch" = "skip-all" ]`; a trailing `\n` breaks the comparison.

## Edge cases

- **Missing or unreadable file** → `full`. The caller cannot resolve a branch, so it takes the one that skips nothing.
- **No recognizable `## Key files` heading** → `full`, on the same reasoning. An absent section is not an empty one.
- **A `###` subheading inside the key-files section** → the section stays open and the rows below it are still counted. Only a `## ` heading closes it.
- **Empty file** → `full`, by the same rule.
- **`Complexity:` appearing in prose rather than the blockquote** → only lines beginning `> ` and containing `Complexity:` are considered, so ordinary prose cannot move the branch.
- **Two blockquote metadata lines** → the first wins, matching the template, which renders exactly one.
- **A `| … |` table elsewhere in the file** (`## Verification steps`, for instance) → not counted; the `## ` heading that opens the next section clears the in-section flag.
- **A key-files path wrapped in backticks** (the template renders `` `path` ``) → backticks are stripped before comparison, so the same path in backticks and bare is one file, not two. This holds for a bullet as well, so `` - `lib/a.ex` `` and `` | `lib/a.ex` | why | `` are one file.
- **A list item whose note is separated by something other than an em dash** (`- lib/a.ex - why`) → the identity is the whole entry, so it still counts as one file but will *not* dedupe against a table row for the same path. That over-counts, which is the safe direction; only the em dash the list form uses is cut.
- **A section mixing a list and a table** → every shape is read and deduped against the others, because the `in_key_files` flag is cleared only by a `## ` heading, not by a change of shape.
- **A numbered item with no space after its marker** (`1.lib/a.ex`) → not an entry. The space is what distinguishes a list marker from prose that opens with a number, and requiring it is what stops `2026-08-06 shipped this. See lib/a.ex` from counting.
- **Two shapes that over-count rather than under-count** are accepted without further handling, because over-counting only costs a dispatch: a placeholder carrying a reason (`- (none — no new files)`) is cut at the em dash to `(none`, which is not the placeholder token and so counts as an entry; and a thematic break written `- - -` or `* * *` survives the separator probe, which strips only `-` and `:` and leaves a space.
- **Deliberate divergence from the enrichment gate on prose.** The gate reads any non-placeholder line as evidence the section is populated; this function counts only rows and bullets. So a key-files section written as a paragraph is "populated" there and 0 here, and a small task with such a section resolves to `skip-all`. The two agree on every table body and every list body, bulleted or numbered, and strip the same marker vocabulary, which is what a hand-written section actually carries; agreeing on prose too would mean counting sentences as files. This divergence is the narrowed remainder of the row-only gap, and the smoke suite pins both halves of it.
- **Five constructions still undercount, and are accepted rather than handled.** An adversarial sweep found these inputs reaching `skip-all` with two or more real paths: an H2-looking line inside a **fenced code block** within the section (which closes it — the parser has no fence tracking); two distinct paths each containing a **literal `|`** (both truncate at the inner pipe and dedupe to one); paths literally named **`File`** or **`(none)`** in any case (dropped by the header and placeholder filters, which run over every shape); a **prose-only** section, per the divergence above; and **note-first list items** that share their text before the em dash (`- The parser — lib/a.ex` twice over) whose identities collide on the shared note. None of the first three is producible by `create-decomposer`, the template renders no fenced block inside `## Key files`, and no credible filename contains a pipe or is named `File`. The note-first shape inverts the convention the em-dash cut is built around; reading the field order both ways would make the identity depend on which side looked more path-like, and a guess in that direction can collide just as easily. Fence tracking and filter-token escaping would add state for a case the system cannot produce — these are recorded so a later reader can see they were weighed, not missed.
